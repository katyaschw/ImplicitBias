	<h2 > What are implicit biases? </h2>
	<br>
	<p class="def">
		<strong> Implicit bias (noun): </strong> the bias in judgment and/or behavior that results
		from subtle cognitive processes, such as implicit attitudes and implicit stereotypes, that
		often operate at a level below conscious awareness and without intentional control.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="def">
		Implicit bias can be a hard thing to measure because it is intrinsically unconscious.
		If the person who has this bias knew that they have it, then it would more likely be
		described as an explicit bias. While implicit bias and explicit bias are related they
		are different mental constructs and are not mutually exclusive.  These implicit associations
		do not necessarily align with our declared beliefs or stances. While implicit biases can be
		hard to pinpoint, they are malleable. Our brains are quite complex and the implicit associations
		that people may have learned previously can be unlearned through a variety of techniques.

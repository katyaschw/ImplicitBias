	<p class="research">
		Research has found that Black and Latinx applicants with no criminal background were just as likely to receive a callback or offer as whites just released from prison.
		The data also supports the idea that removing the box from applications encourages statistical discrimination on the basis of race.
		Overall, white applicants received 23% more callbacks than similar black applicants. Employers that asked about criminal records were 62% more likely to call back an applicant if he has no record. However, research shows that the race gap in callbacks
		grows dramatically after the policy went into effect. Before ban-the-box, white applicants received about 7% more callbacks than similar black applicants, but implementing a ban-the-box policy increased this gap to 45%.
		Another study showed that ban-the-box policies decrease the probability of being employed by 5.1 percent for young, low-skilled black men, and by 2.9 percent for young, low-skilled Hispanic men.
